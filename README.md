# Brass Birmingham Solo

Play **Brass: Birmingham solo in the browser** against the **Mautoma** — the
fan-made card-driven opponent by Mauro Gibertoni. The physical game has no
official solo mode; this app implements the full 2-player rules with the
Automa as your opponent, so nothing needs to be tracked by hand: legal moves,
resource sourcing, markets, income, era scoring and all 22 Automa cards are
automated.

## Features

- **Full rules engine** — build, network, sell, develop, loan, scout, pass;
  closest-coal-mine sourcing, market price tracks, overbuilding, farm
  breweries, the 3-way Kidderminster–farm–Worcester link, era transition,
  shortfall, link + industry scoring.
- **The complete Mautoma** — all 22 cards, three difficulty levels, every
  rulebook and FAQ tiebreaker implemented deterministically (link placement
  priorities, building-selection tiebreaker icons, beer order, first-turn
  rules).
- **Seeded games** — replay the exact same setup and Automa deck by reusing
  a seed.
- **Undo, autosave, game log** — the game survives page reloads; every
  engine event is logged.
- **Dark mode** — follows your system preference, toggleable, persistent.
- **Responsive** — plays on phone-sized screens; e2e-tested on desktop and
  mobile viewports.

## How to play

1. Pick a difficulty (easy / medium / hard — harder mats give the Automa
   better tiles) and start.
2. Each turn you take two actions (one on the very first turn): choose an
   action, then a card from your hand, then a target. Legal targets are
   highlighted on the board and listed as buttons.
3. The Automa takes its whole turn automatically after yours; read the log
   to see what it did.
4. Highest VP after the Rail Era wins.
